**🧠 Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor (Verilog Implementation)**
This project is a Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor implemented in Verilog HDL, based on the concepts presented in Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface (2nd Edition) by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy.
The design follows the architectural concepts explained in Chapter 4, which focuses on the processor datapath and control for RISC-V instructions.

**⚙️ Key Features**
Implemented in Verilog HDL
Supports R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type, and J-type instructions
Includes major datapath components:
Program Counter (PC)
Instruction Memory
Register File
ALU and ALU Control Unit
Control Unit
Data Memory
Adders, MUXes, and Logic Components
Designed as a single-cycle processor (all operations complete in one clock cycle)

**🧩 Tools Used**

Language: Verilog HDL
GVim (Ubuntu): For writing and editing Verilog code
Icarus Verilog (iverilog, vvp): For compiling and simulating the processor
GTKWave: For viewing and analyzing simulation waveforms
